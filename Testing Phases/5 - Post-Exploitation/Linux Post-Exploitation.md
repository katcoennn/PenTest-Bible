# Linux Post-Exploitation

## PolicyKit (‘pkexec’)
PolicyKit is a framework that manages privileges on a Unix-like operating system. pkexec is a command-line tool that allows authorized users to execute system-wide administrative tasks as another user, typically using graphical authentication agents.
If you, as a low-level user, had PolicyKit authorization to execute certain actions with pkexec, it means you had permission to perform specific privileged actions. This might be due to PolicyKit rules configured on the system.

```pkexec –user <low-level user> <high-level command>```  
If vulnerable, you can now run privileged command. Check if you can ```cat /etc/shadow```. 

## LinPeas
linPEAS is a server vulnerability and information scanner script written in pure shell. It's one of the first things you should launch after gaining access to the server, since it will tell you a lot of useful information such as:
* System information (useful for testing old CVEs)
* Password files
* Binaries permissions
* Cron Jobs

To run:
```chmod +x linpeas.sh```
```./linpeas.sh -a > /tmp/linpeas.txt```

## Traitor
https://github.com/liamg/traitor  
Traitor takes advantage of local misconfigurations and vulnerabilities (including most of GTFOBins) in order to pop a root shell. Note that these are primarily misconfigurations, not exploits.
