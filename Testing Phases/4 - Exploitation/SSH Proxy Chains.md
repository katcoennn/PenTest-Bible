# SSH Proxy Chains


## Local Port Forwarding:
Local port forwarding allows you to tunnel traffic from your local machine through an SSH server to a remote destination.  
```ssh -L <local_port>:<remote_host>:<remote_port> <user>@<ssh_server>```

For example, if you want to access a web service on a remote server (remote_host:80) via your local machine's port 8080, you can use this command:  
```ssh -L 8080:remote_host:80 user@ssh_server```

## Remote Port Forwarding:
Remote port forwarding enables you to tunnel traffic from a remote machine through an SSH server to your local machine.  
```ssh -R <remote_port>:<local_host>:<local_port> <user>@<ssh_server>```

This is useful if you want to expose a service on your local machine to a remote server. For example, to expose your local machine's port 8080 to the remote server, you would use:  
```ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 user@ssh_server```

## Dynamic Port Forwarding:
Dynamic port forwarding creates a SOCKS proxy on your local machine. All traffic sent to this proxy is encrypted and forwarded through the SSH server.  
```cat /etc/proxychains4.conf```

See what local port is running socks4. Then use:  
```ssh -D 0000:<local_port> -N -f <user>@<ssh_server>```

Then, run commands on your kali box as you normally would, preceded by ```proxychains``` (ie. ```proxychains nmap -sV <third network box ip>```)  
You can configure your applications to use this proxy to access the internet securely through the SSH server.
