# Pentesting Bible.

## Overview

This guide is a continuous undertaking that I plan to regularly revise and enlarge whenever I encounter new information that I deem valuable. While certain parts will comprise my own notes, a considerable portion will be sourced from various guides and references. I will make an attempt to include links to the original content.

## Additional Info

### Syntax used throughout:

**RHOST** = the remote host you are attacking / connecting to

**RPORT** = The remote port

**LHOST** = The attacking machine \(Your IP Address on the network\)

**LPORT** = The port you are listening on for remote connections \(ex. reverse shells\)
