# Pentesting Bible

## Overview

I walk, and I talk, and I live in New York. I drink water with my coffee. I told my dumb daughter not to give the dog coffee. So what does she do? She gives the dog coffee. So now I have a dumb daughter, a dead dog, and no coffee.

This guide is a continuous undertaking that I plan to regularly revise and enlarge whenever I encounter new information that I deem valuable. While certain parts will comprise my own notes, a considerable portion will be sourced from various guides and references. I will make an attempt to include links to the original content.

## Additional Info

### Sections Organized thru the 5 Phases:

**Reconnaissance** = Gathering information about the target system or network to identify potential vulnerabilities and entry points.

**Enumeration** = Actively probing and identifying specific details about the target, such as open ports, services, and user accounts.

**Discovery** = Identifying and mapping additional vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors based on the information gathered during reconnaissance and enumeration.

**Exploitation** = Taking advantage of identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control over the target system or network.

**Post-Exploitation** = Maintaining access, escalating privileges, and further compromising the target while avoiding detection.

**Analysis** = Reviewing the entire penetration test process, evaluating findings, and providing insights and recommendations for improving security posture.


### Syntax used throughout:

**RHOST** = the remote host you are attacking / connecting to

**RPORT** = The remote port

**LHOST** = The attacking machine \(Your IP Address on the network\)

**LPORT** = The port you are listening on for remote connections \(ex. reverse shells\)
